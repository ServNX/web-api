## The Vision
The idea is a **“Collaboration Platform”**. One that not only focuses on helping teams collaborate amongst each other, 
but one that in addition will help project maintainers recruit contributors and with a robust search and filter system 
will help contributors find projects that are perfect for them!

A project manager can create a project, at which point can link accounts (Optional) such as **GitHub, Bitbucket, SourceForge, 
Gitlab** amongst others. The purpose of this will be to allow a seamless link to the 3rd party service and to integrate 
their features by taking advantage of their developers Api.

`Linked accounts are NOT required, the platform will still have its own integrated tools for collaboration, 
issue tracking, etc …`

There is also the idea of being able to provided additional exposure to projects. For example a Feature Project System
listed below.

## Some Key Features
- Seamlessly work with 3rd party tools like **Github, Bitbucket, etc …**
- Create Organizations and Projects
- Recruiting System `Project Maintainers`
- Robust Search and Filter System

- Roadmap `Integrated`

- Issue Tracker `Integrated`
- Chat Server `Integrated`
    -  `Can disable if they prefer the use of Slack or Discord but can use both`
- Tagging System to assist search and filters 
    - `languages: ‘english’` 
    - `code: ‘php’` 
    - `frameworks: ‘laravel’` 
    - `recruiting: ‘ui’, ‘frontend’, ‘backend’`
    - `beginners: ‘backend’`
- Featured Project System
    - `Provides a daily rotation of premium accounts to advertise their project`
    - `Premium Service can pay per campaign or monthly (per campaign is stackable)`
    - `Project Maintaners will be able to customize there featured project (visually)`
 

## Why ?
A few reasons really. The biggest reason is I think there is a real need for a platform that can consolidate many of 
the services you use separately into one place.

**A few other reasons**
- `Experience, good for resume`
- `A practical way to get involved with 3rd party API's`
- `A great way to meet other developers`
- `And of course potential profits $$$ ;)`
